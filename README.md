## Project Description
### ***Game description and How to play***
+ The idea is based on an old games in the 2010s by OLA Coporation.
+ In 966, two years after the loss of Ngo Quyen king, our country getting in troubles, wars and conflicts happened interminably, shaping 12 warlords to occupy the localities. At that time, the Dinh Bo Linh gathered the people in Hoa Lu, recruited the army, rebelled and disrupted the 12 emissaries. You are a general under the leadership of the Dynasty.
+ After choosing a companion character (6 characters with different skill classes), the player will step straight into combat training with the help of Liu Yuan. The game of the 12th Legion is captured in this exercise.
+ Each battle involves two factions, each of which will alternately move the symbols on the screen to create the same trio horizontally / vertically, aiming at attacking the opponent (scoring 3 swords), dragging blood (3 hearts), taking gold (3 gold coins), taking food (3 crackers), taking experience points (3 books), taking special energy to throw a great blow (3 tornadoes)... (if you get ranked from 4 identical symbols, you are rewarded with the turn).
+ Each battle is like a quest, if you win you will have lots of gold and experience points to upgrade. The more scratched, the stronger the ability to attack and the more blood. Gold is used to buy special items such as Devil's armor, jewelry... or beard at other events.
